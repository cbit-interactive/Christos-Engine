Unified Render
****************************************************************************
This is the main game engine used by Symphony Of Empires. This is an in
house built engine, only depending on a few things to make it work.

DEBUGGING
****************************************************************************
Often the game engine can encounter internal errors, due to performance
reasons said errors won't be checked against, to enable checking see the
following macros.

DEFINES
****************************************************************************

E3D_DEBUG
    When defined will enable all rendering pipeline error checks (can cause
    massive lag on graphical intensive tasks), this also enables the debug
    mode for the memory allocation subsystem, if E3D_MANAGED_HEAP is used.
    Additionally it will enable several critical debug assertions and
    statments.

E3D_BACKEND_OPENGL
    If defined it will use the OpenGL backend.

E3D_MANAGED_HEAP
    Enables or disables the custom `new` and `delete` operators
